## Repo Setup

To develop locally, fork the @hdoc-react/components repository and clone it in your local machine. The repo is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces, nx and @changesets/cli for manage packages.

To develop a given package:

1. Run `pnpm i` in root folder
2. Run `pnpm nx dev --open @hdoc-react/[package-name]` in root folder
3. Run `pnpm changeset` or `npx changeset` in root folder for track changes of a package
