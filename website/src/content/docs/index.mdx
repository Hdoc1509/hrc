import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Principles

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Simple to use" icon="pencil">
    Each component is designed to be simple and easy to use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No CSS-in-JS" icon="add-document">
    CSS is powerful enough. All styles can be customized via CSS variables or
    custom CSS rules/classes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Easy to customize" icon="setting">
    Customize each component to suit your needs by using its ready-to-use
    variants.
  </Card>
  <Card title="BEM based" icon="open-book">
    Components are based on the [BEM methodology](https://getbem.com/). You
    don't need to worry about [CSS specificity
    issues](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#tips_for_handling_specificity_headaches) (in most of cases).
