<Aside type="caution">
  As this is an Astro project, this component required to use a
  [`client directive`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/)
  in order to work and it can cause to delay its initial rendering.

  If you want to avoid the possibility of a delay in an Astro project, you can
  check out the following resources:
    - [Theme Toggle from Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/6-islands/2/)

    - [ThemeSelect from Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#themeselect)
