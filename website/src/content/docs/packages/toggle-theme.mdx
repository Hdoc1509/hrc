<Aside type="caution">
  This component is designed to be used in a React project. It is just used here
  to show the usage of the component.

  Although the component is used to handle the theme of this website, it is not
  the best way to do so, as this is an Astro project. It required to use a
  [`client directive`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/)
  in order to work, causing the component to delay its initial rendering.

  I recommend to use a native Astro component for Astro projects.

  You can check out the following:
    - [Theme Toggle from Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/6-islands/2/)
    - [ThemeProvider from Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#themeprovider)
    - [ThemeSelect from Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#themeselect)
