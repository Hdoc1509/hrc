## Light Mode First

With this approach, you declare your `light` colors first and then use
`[data-theme="dark"]` to set your `dark` colors.

<Demo>
  <LightFirst client:only="react" />
</Demo>

<MultiSourceCode sources={lightSources} />

## Dark Mode First

With this approach, you declare your `dark` colors first and then use
`[data-theme="light"]` to set your `light` colors.

<Demo>
  <DarkFirst client:only="react" />
</Demo>

<MultiSourceCode sources={darkSources} />

## Load theme on page load

If you want to load the theme before the page is rendered, you can import
`load-theme.ts` file in your `index.html` or respective entry point:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="node_modules/@hrc/toggle-theme/dist/load-theme.js"
></script>
```

If you are using [Astro](https://astro.build/), you can use `loadTheme` util
in your layout:

```html
<script>
  import { loadTheme } from "@hrc/toggle-theme";

  loadTheme();
</script>
```

:::caution
Only use this approach if your theme is not loaded as fast as you want it to be,
because `<ThemeButton />` component also loads the theme in its intial render.
:::

## Custom key for `localStorage`

Use the `customKey` prop to set a custom key for `localStorage` to store the
theme.

```js
export function WithCustomKeyDemo() {
  return (
    <ThemeButton
      customKey="my-custom-key"
      lightElement={{/* element for light mode */}}
      darkElement={{/* element for dark mode */}}
    />
  );
}
```

:::caution
If you are [loading the theme on page load](#load-theme-on-page-load), you
should use `loadTheme()` util with the same custom key.

- In your `index.html` or respective entry point:

  ```html
  <script type="module">
    import { loadTheme } from "@hrc/toggle-theme";

    loadTheme("my-custom-key");
  </script>
  ```

- In your `Astro` layout:

  ```js
  import { loadTheme } from "@hrc/toggle-theme";

  loadTheme("my-custom-key");
  ```
